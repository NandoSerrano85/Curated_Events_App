I've created a comprehensive business plan for your curated events platform. The key insight is positioning this as a "premium" alternative to existing platforms by solving the quality problem that frustrates both event-goers and creators.
A few critical points to consider as you develop this:
The curation challenge: Your biggest operational challenge will be scaling the human review process while maintaining quality. I'd recommend starting with a very focused geographic area (maybe just a few neighborhoods in one city) to perfect the curation process before expanding.
Community code review system: This could be your secret weapon. Think of it like Stack Overflow for events - trusted community members can flag issues, suggest improvements, or verify event quality. You might even gamify this with reputation points for helpful community moderators.
Social media integration: Beyond just sharing, consider deeper integrations like importing Instagram/Facebook events for review, or allowing creators to cross-post approved events automatically.
The business model focuses on quality over volume, which should allow for premium pricing and better unit economics than platforms that race to the bottom on fees.

Architecture Highlights
Microservices Design: Each service has clear responsibilities and can scale independently. This is crucial for your curation workflow where different services may have very different load patterns.
Event-Driven Architecture: Using Kafka for async communication between services ensures loose coupling and enables real-time features like notifications and activity feeds.
Hybrid Data Strategy: Different data stores optimized for their use cases:

PostgreSQL for transactional data (users, events)
Elasticsearch for search and discovery
MongoDB for flexible event metadata
Redis for caching and real-time features

Critical Technical Considerations
Curation Service: This is your unique differentiator. The AI pre-screening combined with human review creates a two-tier quality gate. The ML models will improve over time based on curator decisions.
Search & Discovery: The recommendation engine combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and trending signals. This provides personalized discovery while surfacing quality events.
Social Integration: Deep integration with major platforms enables viral growth while the community review system creates network effects.
Real-time Features: WebSocket connections for live updates, real-time analytics pipeline, and instant search results create an engaging user experience.
A few questions to help refine the architecture:

Geographic Strategy: Will you launch city-by-city or region-by-region? This affects how you partition data and deploy services.
Curation Scale: How many events do you expect to process daily at launch vs. at scale? This determines the AI/human reviewer ratio.
Mobile-First: Should the mobile app have offline capabilities for saved events and basic browsing?

Major Design Decisions Explained
1. Database Schema Design

UUID Primary Keys: Better for distributed systems and security (no sequential enumeration)
JSONB for Flexible Data: Event metadata, user preferences, and settings use JSONB for flexibility
PostGIS for Geospatial: Native geospatial queries for location-based features
Soft Deletes: deleted_at timestamps preserve data integrity and enable audit trails

2. API Architecture Choices

GraphQL Federation: Allows clients to request exactly what they need, reducing over-fetching
REST Fallbacks: Simple operations like authentication still use REST for simplicity
Cursor-based Pagination: More stable than offset-based, especially for real-time feeds

3. Performance Optimizations

DataLoader Pattern: Eliminates N+1 query problems in GraphQL resolvers
Multi-tier Caching: Memory → Redis → CDN for optimal performance
Read/Write Splitting: Distributes database load across replicas

Critical Implementation Considerations
Curation Workflow: The AI pre-screening → human review → community oversight pipeline is the core differentiator. The data model supports detailed audit trails and quality scoring.
Real-time Features: WebSocket subscriptions for live updates, combined with event-driven cache invalidation, creates a responsive user experience.
Search & Discovery: The hybrid approach combining Elasticsearch for search with PostgreSQL for transactions provides both powerful search capabilities and ACID guarantees.
Security: Multi-layered approach with rate limiting, input sanitization, parameterized queries, and comprehensive validation.
A few implementation questions to consider:

Event Recurrence: How complex should recurring event support be? The schema supports RRULE format, but the UI complexity grows quickly.
Offline Support: Should the mobile app cache events for offline browsing? This affects the data sync strategy.
Multi-tenancy: Will you support white-label deployments for cities/organizations? This impacts the data partitioning strategy.
International Expansion: How will you handle multiple languages, currencies, and local regulations?

Key Implementation Highlights
AI Pre-Screening System:

Multi-stage parallel processing (completeness, content quality, image assessment, spam detection)
Continuous model training based on curator feedback
Confidence scoring and automated decision thresholds

Human Review System:

Smart queue prioritization based on urgency, curator expertise, and AI confidence
Comprehensive review interface with detailed scoring rubrics
Performance analytics and curator specialization tracking

Community Oversight:

Reputation-weighted post-event feedback
Statistical anomaly detection for outlier reviews
Pattern recognition for systemic quality issues

State Machine & Orchestration:

Robust workflow management with proper error handling
Background job processing with retry logic
Real-time monitoring and alerting

Critical Success Factors

Quality Consistency: The three-tier system (AI → Human → Community) ensures high-quality events while scaling efficiently
Performance Optimization: Parallel processing, intelligent caching, and queue management handle high volumes
Continuous Improvement: ML models retrain based on curator decisions, creating a feedback loop that improves over time
Transparency: Comprehensive metrics and audit trails provide visibility into the curation process
Scalability: The microservices architecture allows independent scaling of different components

Implementation Priorities
Phase 1: Core AI screening + basic human review
Phase 2: Advanced queue management + curator analytics
Phase 3: Community oversight + real-time monitoring
Phase 4: External integrations + advanced ML features
The system is designed to start simple and evolve in complexity, allowing you to validate the core concept while building toward the full vision.

Strategic Approach
The plan follows a "Quality-First Density" strategy - building deep penetration in select markets rather than spreading thin. This aligns perfectly with your curation-focused value proposition.
Launch Markets
I've recommended starting with Austin, Portland, and Boulder - cities that match your target demographics and have the cultural characteristics that would embrace a premium, curated platform over mainstream alternatives.
Phased Launch Strategy

Pre-Launch: Technology preparation and community seeding
Soft Launch: Invite-only with founding members
Public Launch: Full marketing push with clear differentiation
Growth Phase: Revenue acceleration and market leadership

Competitive Positioning
The analysis shows clear differentiation opportunities against Facebook Events (quality vs. spam), Eventbrite (discovery vs. just ticketing), and Meetup (modern UX vs. dated interface).
The plan emphasizes building community trust and creator loyalty before expanding geographically, which should help avoid the common marketplace chicken-and-egg problem. The revenue projections are conservative but realistic, focusing on sustainable growth rather than unsustainable user acquisition.

Language Distribution Strategy
Go Services (High Concurrency & Performance):

API Gateway & Load Balancer
User Service (authentication, sessions)
